# Yuna's First README
Right! Okay, so my name is Ari, and I'm creating this as an introduction to GitHub, via JetBrains Academy.
This is a pretty dumb bot, but it's her birthday so you have to be kind to her.
Those are the rules.

Also her developer has never used GitHub before so you have to be kind to her, too...
Sorry, I don't make the rules.


Maybe I'll make updates to this bot in the future, as I get better at developing my ideas via code?
